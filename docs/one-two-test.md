The impact of inheriting software artifacts on future problem solving
================

# Research questions

1.  How does inheriting a partial solution from someone else compare to
    solving the full problem individually?
2.  Are some languages more heritable than others?

# Methods

## Materials

Participants solved programming puzzles taken from
Exercism.io.
