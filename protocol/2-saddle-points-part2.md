# Switching from part1 to part2

When a participant has finished part 1 of the saddle points problem, follow
these steps to start them on part2.

1. Open a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+t) and type the following line to run a
script that merges in part2.

```
~/.bin/merge-saddle-points-part2.py
```

2. If a new file containing Part2 tests doesn't appear in their IDE, refresh the
project from the file menu.
