# One-Two Test Experiment

## Experiment 1

How much of a benefit is there to knowing all tests ahead of time as opposed to
completing them one at a time? In this experiment, participants are assigned to
receive both tests at the same time (**omniscient**), or to receive one test
after completing the other (**modular**). In the modular condition, participants
are not aware of the requirements of the second test until after their solution
satisfies the first test.

## Experiment 2

How much of a cost is there to inheriting from someone else as opposed to
solving it individually? In this experiment, participants are assigned to
one of three conditions. The first two conditions are the omniscient and
modular conditions as in Exp. 1, above. The new condition is the second
generation condition. Participants in the second generation condition
start off with a solution from an omniscient or modular condition participant
that satisfies one of the tests.
